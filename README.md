# Wheelock-2023-Brain-NLA-Neurofilament-Cognitive-RSN

This is my contribution to the Wheelock et al. 2023 Brain article "Brain network decoupling with increased serum neurofilament and reduced cognitive function in Alzheimerâ€™s disease".

I used random forest regression to address reviewer's response on the robustness of the results from the hierarchical regression reported in the article.

Additionally, I did the data curation to calculate the cognitive composite scores from four independent cognitive tests.
